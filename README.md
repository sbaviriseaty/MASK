# Computer Applications for BME Fall 2020: Team MASK
## Detecting Diabetic Retinopathy in Fundus Images using Image Processing 
### Objective
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness in American adults.  The significance of this issue has led to the creation of this project in order to make it easier to detect DR. The goal is that it will lower the instances of DR leading to blindness by allowing people to detect DR at its early stages. After creating the code, the team decided to create a Matlab application that will make the code more user-friendly.  This way, anybody can upload their own retinal image and be able to find out the severity of DR present.
### Project
*Built with MATLAB R2020b*
**Data:** Data is from Kaggleâ€™s [2015 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data) 
Batch images folder contains the 10 images used and access to Matlab Application <br />
**Report:** Report Pdf has the project report in depth and the report_images contains images used in the report <br />
**Code:** Code used for Matlab Application can be found in final_code <br />
* Importing images
* Preprocessing images
* Eliminating vessels
* Subtracting optic disks
